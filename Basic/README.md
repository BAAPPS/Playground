## Summary

### Day 1 – Variables, Constants, and Strings

- Learned how to declare variables (`var`) and constants (`let`), and understood the difference between mutable and immutable values.
- Created and manipulated strings, including:
  - Using escape characters for quotes inside strings.
  - Writing multi-line strings with triple quotes.
  - Using string properties and methods such as `.count`, `.uppercased()`, `.hasPrefix()`, and `.hasSuffix()`.
- Practiced basic printing to the console with `print()`.

### Day 2 – Numbers and Booleans

- Explored whole numbers (integers) and decimal numbers (floating-point, `Double`), including:
  - Numeric literals with underscores for readability.
  - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and compound assignment operators (`+=`, `*=`, etc.).
  - Type safety in Swift and explicit type conversion between `Int` and `Double`.
- Worked with Booleans (`true`/`false`), including:
  - Using logical NOT operator `!` and `.toggle()` method.
- Applied string interpolation to embed variables and expressions inside strings.
- Completed a checkpoint exercise converting Celsius to Fahrenheit.
