# Swift Practice ‚Äì 100 Days of Swift

This repository contains my personal practice and notes while following the [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) curriculum by Paul Hudson. All code is written and tested in `.playground` files, organized by day and topic.

---

## üöÄ Purpose

The goal of this project is to reinforce Swift fundamentals through daily, hands-on coding using Swift Playgrounds. Each day focuses on a specific core concept, with practical exercises and small test cases.

## üõ† Requirements

- Xcode (tested with version compatible with Swift 5+)
- macOS (Playgrounds are designed to run in Xcode)

## üìå Notes

- These files are **not production-ready code** ‚Äî they're for learning and experimentation.
- Feel free to fork this repo or use the examples for your own learning.
