# Swift Practice ‚Äì 100 Days of Swift

This repository contains my personal practice and notes while following the [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) curriculum by Paul Hudson. All code is written and tested in `.playground` files, organized by day and topic.

---

## üöÄ Purpose

The goal of this project is to reinforce Swift fundamentals through daily, hands-on coding using Swift Playgrounds. Each day focuses on a specific core concept, with practical exercises and small test cases.

## üìö Topics Covered

### ‚úÖ Days 1‚Äì6 Completed

- **Day 1** ‚Äì Variables, constants, strings, and numbers: [Swift Fundamental 1](https://github.com/BAAPPS/Playgrounds/blob/main/Basics.playground/Contents.swift)
- **Day 2** ‚Äì Booleans, string interpolation, and checkpoint 1: [Swift Fundamental 2](https://github.com/BAAPPS/Playgrounds/blob/main/Basics.playground/Contents.swift)
- **Day 3** ‚Äì Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums (Complex data types): [Swift Fundamental 3](https://github.com/BAAPPS/Playgrounds/blob/main/complexDataTypes.playground/Contents.swift)
- **Day 4** ‚Äì Type annotations and checkpoint 2 (Complex data types): [Swift Fundamental 4](https://github.com/BAAPPS/Playgrounds/blob/main/complexDataTypes.playground/Contents.swift)
- **Day 5** ‚Äì If, switch, and the ternary operator (Conditions): [Swift Fundamental 5](https://github.com/BAAPPS/Playground/blob/main/Conditions/Conditions.playground/Contents.swift)
- **Day 6** ‚Äì Loops, summary, and checkpoint 3: [Swift Fundamental 6](https://github.com/BAAPPS/Playground/blob/main/Loops/Loops.playground/Contents.swift)

## üõ† Requirements

- Xcode (tested with version compatible with Swift 5+)
- macOS (Playgrounds are designed to run in Xcode)

## üìå Notes

- These files are **not production-ready code** ‚Äî they're for learning and experimentation.
- Feel free to fork this repo or use the examples for your own learning.
