# Swift Practice – 100 Days of Swift

This repository contains my personal practice and notes while following the [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) curriculum by Paul Hudson. All code is written and tested in `.playground` files, organized by day and topic.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this project is to reinforce Swift fundamentals through daily, hands-on coding using Swift Playgrounds. Each day focuses on a specific core concept, with practical exercises and small test cases.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### ✅ Days 1–3 Completed

- **Day 1** – Variables, constants, strings, and numbers  [Swift Fundamental 1](https://github.com/BAAPPS/Playgrounds/blob/main/Basics.playground/Contents.swift)
- **Day 2** – Booleans, string interpolation, and checkpoint 1  [Swift Fundamental 2](https://github.com/BAAPPS/Playgrounds/blob/main/Basics.playground/Contents.swift)
- **Day 3** – Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums   [Swift Fundamental 3](https://github.com/BAAPPS/Playgrounds/blob/main/complexDataTypes.playground/Contents.swift)

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Xcode (tested with version compatible with Swift 5+)
- macOS (Playgrounds are designed to run in Xcode)

---

## 📌 Notes

- These files are **not production-ready code** — they're for learning and experimentation.
- Feel free to fork this repo or use the examples for your own learning.
