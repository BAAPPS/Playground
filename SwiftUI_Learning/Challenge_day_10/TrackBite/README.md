# Challenge Day 10 – TrackBite

---

## Project Overview

TrackBite is a full-stack iOS app designed to simulate real-time catering delivery tracking. Built with SwiftUI and MapKit on the frontend and powered by Supabase on the backend, it enables users to explore key app 
development concepts like map annotations, driver movement simulation, offline-first data persistence, and cloud synchronization. The app models features found in popular services like Yelp and DoorDash, making it a 
practical and engaging learning project.

## Technologies Used

* **SwiftUI** — for building modern, declarative UI
* **MapKit** — to display maps, pins, and animate driver location
* **Supabase** — backend-as-a-service for data storage, authentication, and syncing
* **Swift Codable & FileManager** — for offline JSON data persistence
* **Network framework** — to detect connectivity and manage offline/online mode
* **Unsplash image links** — to fetch themed images without API keys

---

## Features

* Full-stack integration with Supabase backend
* Role-based users: drivers, customers, and admins
* Dynamic restaurant and order management
* Real-time driver movement simulation on maps
* Offline-first data persistence with local JSON files
* Network status detection and syncing between local and cloud data
* Clean MVVM architecture for scalable and maintainable code

## Why This Challenge?

I will gain hands-on experience integrating frontend map features with backend data services, managing offline-first persistence, and handling multi-user scenarios — essential skills for building robust, production-quality 
apps.

It’s designed to help me:

* Build confidence with real-world app architecture
* Understand syncing complexities between offline and online states
* Create interactive, map-based experiences that users love
* Practice role-based authentication and data access
