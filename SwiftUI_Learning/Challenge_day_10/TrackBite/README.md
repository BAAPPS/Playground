* **SwiftUI** ‚Äî for building modern, declarative UI
* **MapKit** ‚Äî to display maps, pins, and animate driver location
* **Supabase** ‚Äî backend-as-a-service for data storage, authentication, and syncing
* **Swift Codable & FileManager** ‚Äî for offline JSON data persistence
* **Network framework** ‚Äî to detect connectivity and manage offline/online mode
* **Unsplash image links** ‚Äî to fetch themed images without API keys

---

## Features

* Full-stack integration with Supabase backend
* Role-based users: drivers, customers, and admins
* Dynamic restaurant and order management
* Real-time driver movement simulation on maps
* Offline-first data persistence with local JSON files
* Network status detection and syncing between local and cloud data
* Clean MVVM architecture for scalable and maintainable code

---

## Why This Challenge?

I will gain hands-on experience integrating frontend map features with backend data services, managing offline-first persistence, and handling multi-user scenarios ‚Äî essential skills for building robust, production-quality 
apps.

It‚Äôs designed to help me:

* Build confidence with real-world app architecture
* Understand syncing complexities between offline and online states
* Create interactive, map-based experiences that users love
* Practice role-based authentication and data access

## What I Learned


### NavigationLink(value:) + navigationDestination(for:) 

As part of building my restaurant management feature in TrackBite, I implemented SwiftUI‚Äôs NavigationLink(value:) alongside navigationDestination(for:) to navigate from a restaurant card to a detailed update view.

This approach taught me the value of SwiftUI‚Äôs modern data-driven navigation system. Unlike the older .sheet or .isPresented approaches, this method allowed me to:

- Pass full data models (like RestaurantModel) directly into navigation

Avoid unnecessary state management for tracking selections

- Write clean, scalable code that works great in lists and grids

- Embrace SwiftUI‚Äôs type-safe navigation tied to my domain models

This pattern reflects how real-world apps manage detail views ‚Äî where tapping a card leads to editing or viewing a full data object. It‚Äôs especially valuable when working with backend-driven models, like Supabase in my 
case.


### Using a Singleton ViewModel (`.shared`) for Global Access

In this project, I explored how to simplify access to core view models (like authentication or network managers) by using the singleton pattern:

```swift
@Observable
class SupabaseAuthVM {
    static let shared = SupabaseAuthVM()
    var isLoading = false
    var errorMessage: String?
}
```

This allows any view or service in the app to access shared logic or state globally using:

```swift
let authVM = SupabaseAuthVM.shared
```

#### Benefits I Discovered:

* **No need to pass data down** through props or environment objects.
* **Centralized logic**, especially useful for auth, network monitoring, or caching.
* **Cleaner and more modular code**, particularly in cross-cutting features like session restoration or sign out.

#### Tradeoffs to Keep in Mind:

* **Harder to mock in unit tests**, since the singleton is tightly coupled.
* **Not ideal for all view models**, especially those with state tied closely to the UI.
* To keep SwiftUI observing changes, it‚Äôs still recommended to expose singletons via:

  ```swift
  @Environment(SupabaseAuthVM.self) var auth
  ```

This way, I get the best of both worlds ‚Äî **global access** and **automatic view updates**.

### How to Persist Data Locally in iOS

**Overview:**
Persisting data locally involves saving JSON-encoded model data to the app‚Äôs Documents directory using `FileManager`, `JSONEncoder`, and `JSONDecoder`. This approach enables your app to retain data between launches and 
provide offline access.

**Why Local Storage Matters:**
Local storage is essential for offline support. It allows the app to display previously fetched data even without an internet connection, improving reliability and user experience.

**Resources Folder vs. Documents Directory:**

* **Resources Folder:** Contains files bundled with the app; these are read-only at runtime.
* **Documents Directory:** A writable directory where the app can save and update files. Data here persists across app launches.

**Reusable, Type-Safe Storage with Generics:**
Using a generic class like `SaveDataLocallyVM<T: Codable>` allows saving and loading arrays of any Codable model (e.g., `[RestaurantModel]`, `[UserModel]`). This promotes code reuse and type safety.

**File Location During Development:**
Saved files are stored inside the app‚Äôs sandbox under a path like:
`.../Containers/Data/Application/<UUID>/Documents/`
You can print this path to access and inspect the saved JSON file.

**Verifying Data Integrity:**
After saving, you can open and review the formatted JSON file to confirm that the structure and content match your models and expectations.

## Challenges and Problems Encountered

### 1. Problem: Attempting Cached Login with SwiftData Only

Initially, I tried to persist the logged-in user session using only **SwiftData** by saving the `LocalUser` object locally. While this approach preserved the data in the local store, it failed to provide a reliable session 
experience on app relaunch.

#### Issues:

* There was **no persistent session identifier** across launches.
* SwiftData doesn't support a built-in "current user" concept ‚Äî it just stores data.
* On app restart, I had **no way of knowing which user was the active session** without additional context.
* Fetching all users and selecting one arbitrarily was **unreliable and unsafe**, especially when multiple users exist in the store.

#### ‚ùå Code Example: Unreliable SwiftData-only Attempt

```swift
@MainActor
func loadCachedUserFromSwiftDataOnly() {
    let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<LocalUser>()
    if let user = try? modelContext.fetch(descriptor).first {
        currentUser = user
    }
}
```

**Problem:** This fetches the *first* user it finds ‚Äî not necessarily the one that was last logged in.


#### Solution: Combine SwiftData with UserDefaults

To solve this issue, I introduced a **hybrid solution**:

* **SwiftData** continues to store user information persistently.
* **UserDefaults** stores the `id` of the last logged-in user, acting as a session pointer.

This allowed me to reliably:

* Identify the correct user on relaunch.
* Maintain offline access to the session.
* Keep SwiftData lean and focused on data persistence, while UserDefaults handles quick-access session metadata.

##### ‚úÖ Code Example: Stable Cached Session with ID Pointer

```swift
// Save the user's ID after login
UserDefaults.standard.set(user.id, forKey: "cachedUserID")

// Later, restore the correct user from SwiftData using the ID
@MainActor
func loadCachedUserFromID() {
    guard let cachedID = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "cachedUserID") else {
        print("üü° No cached user ID found")
        return
    }

    let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<LocalUser>(predicate: #Predicate { $0.id == cachedID })
    if let user = try? modelContext.fetch(descriptor).first {
        currentUser = user
        print("üì¶ Loaded cached user from SwiftData: \(user.email)")
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Result:** On every launch, I now reliably fetch the last active user. If the user exists in SwiftData and the cached ID is still valid, they are logged in automatically ‚Äî creating a smooth, offline-friendly session experience.

### 2. Problem: Inconsistent Navigation to Onboarding After Sign Up

During development, I encountered a confusing issue where **the app would sometimes skip the onboarding flow entirely and jump straight to the logged-in view**, even immediately after a user signed up. This behavior was 
inconsistent between the **Preview canvas** and the **iOS Simulator**, making debugging even trickier.

#### Symptoms:

* After successful sign-up, the app should show a tailored onboarding view based on the user‚Äôs role.
* In Preview, onboarding appeared correctly.
* In Simulator, it would skip onboarding and jump directly to the main `LoggedInView`.

#### Root Cause:

This behavior stemmed from my reliance on `localAuthVM.currentUser` alone to determine what to show:

```swift
if localAuthVM.currentUser != nil {
    LoggedInView(authVM: authVM)
} else {
    AuthSwitcherView(authVM: authVM)
}
```

Because the user was cached and loaded immediately after sign-up, `currentUser` was **already non-nil** before navigation occurred ‚Äî **bypassing the onboarding logic** unintentionally.

Also:

* **Preview runs in a clean environment** ‚Äî no persistent UserDefaults or SwiftData ‚Äî so onboarding appeared as expected.
* **Simulator retains cached data** ‚Äî so `currentUser` was restored immediately, skipping onboarding.

#### ‚ùå Problematic Logic (Before)

```swift
if localAuthVM.currentUser != nil {
    LoggedInView(authVM: authVM) // Gets shown even if onboarding not completed
}
```

#### Solution: Introduce Persistent Onboarding Completion Flag

To fix this, I added a `hasCompletedOnboarding` flag to `LocalAuthVM`, stored in `UserDefaults`. This boolean explicitly tracks whether the user has finished onboarding, giving me full control over the app‚Äôs flow.

```swift
var hasCompletedOnboarding: Bool {
    get { UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "hasCompletedOnboarding") }
    set { UserDefaults.standard.set(newValue, forKey: "hasCompletedOnboarding") }
}
```

Then I updated the view logic in `ContentView`:

##### ‚úÖ Improved Flow Logic

```swift
if localAuthVM.currentUser != nil {
    if localAuthVM.hasCompletedOnboarding {
        LoggedInView(authVM: authVM)
    } else {
        OnboardingView(userRole: localAuthVM.currentUser!.role)
    }
} else {
    AuthSwitcherView(authVM: authVM)
}
```

Finally, after the user finishes onboarding, I set the flag:

```swift
localAuthVM.hasCompletedOnboarding = true
```

#### ‚úÖ Result: Predictable, Role-Specific Flow

* Users are always taken to the correct onboarding screen after sign-up.
* App persists onboarding status across launches using `UserDefaults`.
* Clear separation between auth, onboarding, and main app views.
* Debugging is much easier because Preview and Simulator now behave consistently (once cache is cleared).

### 3. Problem: UUID Mismatch During Onboarding

**Issue:** During customer onboarding, the `id` used in `CustomerModel` did not match the `auth.uid()` from Supabase. This happened because the user ID from Supabase (`localAuthVM.currentUser?.id`) wasn't yet available 
when `ContentView` appeared, leading to a temporary `UUID()` being used instead.

**What went wrong:**

* `onAppear` ran too early, before the user was fully signed in.
* A new random UUID was incorrectly assigned, breaking RLS `WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id)`.

**Solution:**
Used `onChange(of: localAuthVM.currentUser)` to defer logic until the user was actually available. This guaranteed the real `auth.uid()` was present before creating or updating the onboarding model.

```swift
.onChange(of: localAuthVM.currentUser) { _, _ in
    if let userIDString = localAuthVM.currentUser?.id,
       let userUUID = UUID(uuidString: userIDString) {
        customerVM = CustomerVM(customerModel: CustomerModel(id: userUUID, ...))
    }
}
```

This reactive approach ensured model updates were synced with Supabase's authenticated user ID.

### 4. Problem: Prop Drilling and State Management

**Issue:** As the app grew, onboarding and shared user state needed to flow through multiple view layers, leading to prop drilling ‚Äî where props were passed down several levels unnecessarily.

**Solution:**
Adopted the new Swift 5.9+ data flow system using `@Observable` view models and `@Environment(...)` injection.

```swift
@Observable class CustomerVM { ... }

@main
struct TrackBiteApp: App {
    @State private var customerVM = CustomerVM(...)

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environment(customerVM) // accessible app-wide
        }
    }
}
```

This eliminated the need to pass state manually through view hierarchies, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

### 5. Problem: Syncing Onboarding Status Between Supabase and UserDefaults

Initially, onboarding completion was managed only locally via `UserDefaults`. However, this caused inconsistencies when the app relaunched or was used on multiple devices, because the backend Supabase data was not updated 
and didn‚Äôt reflect the onboarding state.


#### Solution: Sync Onboarding Status During User Cache

To solve this, I:

* Added a boolean column `hasCompletedOnboarding` to the Supabase `users` table.
* Updated the onboarding status in Supabase once onboarding completed.
* Modified the local user caching function `cacheUserLocally(_:)` to **check the Supabase user‚Äôs `hasCompletedOnboarding` flag**.
* When `true`, it immediately calls `setCompletedOnboarding()` to **update the local UserDefaults**, syncing local onboarding state with the backend.

This guarantees that every time a user is fetched or cached, the local onboarding status stays in sync with the canonical source in Supabase.

#### Code Snippet ‚Äî Sync Onboarding Flag on Cache

```swift
func cacheUserLocally(_ user: SupabaseUser) async throws {
    // ...existing caching logic...

    try await MainActor.run {
        // insert or update user in SwiftData
        // ...

        currentUser = localUser
        
        if user.hasCompletedOnboarding {
            setCompletedOnboarding() // sync UserDefaults here
            print("‚úÖ Synced onboarding status from Supabase to UserDefaults")
        }
    }
}
```


This approach unified the onboarding state across backend and local storage, preventing inconsistent onboarding screens and improving the user experience by always reflecting the true onboarding completion status.

### 6. Problem: Edits to Restaurant Orders Not Persisting After Sheet Dismissal

While building the restaurant order management flow, I ran into a confusing bug: **edits to an order made in a sheet were not reflected in the main UI** after the sheet was dismissed. The changes appeared to save visually 
within the sheet, but disappeared once it closed.

#### Issues:

* I passed a **local copy** of the order using `@State`, not a direct binding to the source.
* After the `.sheet` was dismissed, the local changes were **never written back** into the main order list (`restaurantCustomerOrders`) inside the view model.
* This caused the user to think their changes were saved, when they actually weren't.

#### ‚ùå Code Example: Sheet With Local State (No Sync Back)

```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $isEditMode) {
    RestaurantOrderEditView(order: $editableOrder)
}
```

This presented the edit form and allowed changes, but after dismissing the sheet, nothing triggered an update to the main view model.

#### Solution: Manually Sync Edits Using `.onDismiss`

To fix this, I used the `onDismiss` closure on `.sheet` to explicitly **write back the updated local state** into the view model's array:

##### ‚úÖ Code Example: Working Sheet with Manual Sync

```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $isEditMode, onDismiss: {
    if let index = restaurantOrderViewModel.restaurantCustomerOrders.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == editableOrder.id }) {
        restaurantOrderViewModel.restaurantCustomerOrders[index] = editableOrder
    }
}) {
    RestaurantOrderEditView(order: $editableOrder)
}
```

Now, whenever the sheet is dismissed:

* The latest version of `editableOrder` is saved back into `restaurantCustomerOrders`.
* The main view updates correctly, reflecting the user's changes.

‚úÖ **Result:** Edits made in the sheet persist across the app, even after dismissing the modal. The user experience is now consistent and intuitive.
