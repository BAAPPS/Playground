## Challenges and Problems Encountered

### 1. Problem: Attempting Cached Login with SwiftData Only

Initially, I tried to persist the logged-in user session using only **SwiftData** by saving the `LocalUser` object locally. While this approach preserved the data in the local store, it failed to provide a reliable session 
experience on app relaunch.

#### Issues:

* There was **no persistent session identifier** across launches.
* SwiftData doesn't support a built-in "current user" concept ‚Äî it just stores data.
* On app restart, I had **no way of knowing which user was the active session** without additional context.
* Fetching all users and selecting one arbitrarily was **unreliable and unsafe**, especially when multiple users exist in the store.

#### ‚ùå Code Example: Unreliable SwiftData-only Attempt

```swift
@MainActor
func loadCachedUserFromSwiftDataOnly() {
    let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<LocalUser>()
    if let user = try? modelContext.fetch(descriptor).first {
        currentUser = user
    }
}
```

**Problem:** This fetches the *first* user it finds ‚Äî not necessarily the one that was last logged in.


#### Solution: Combine SwiftData with UserDefaults

To solve this issue, I introduced a **hybrid solution**:

* **SwiftData** continues to store user information persistently.
* **UserDefaults** stores the `id` of the last logged-in user, acting as a session pointer.

This allowed me to reliably:

* Identify the correct user on relaunch.
* Maintain offline access to the session.
* Keep SwiftData lean and focused on data persistence, while UserDefaults handles quick-access session metadata.

##### ‚úÖ Code Example: Stable Cached Session with ID Pointer

```swift
// Save the user's ID after login
UserDefaults.standard.set(user.id, forKey: "cachedUserID")

// Later, restore the correct user from SwiftData using the ID
@MainActor
func loadCachedUserFromID() {
    guard let cachedID = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "cachedUserID") else {
        print("üü° No cached user ID found")
        return
    }

    let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<LocalUser>(predicate: #Predicate { $0.id == cachedID })
    if let user = try? modelContext.fetch(descriptor).first {
        currentUser = user
        print("üì¶ Loaded cached user from SwiftData: \(user.email)")
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Result:** On every launch, I now reliably fetch the last active user. If the user exists in SwiftData and the cached ID is still valid, they are logged in automatically ‚Äî creating a smooth, offline-friendly session experience.

### 2. Problem: Inconsistent Navigation to Onboarding After Sign Up

During development, I encountered a confusing issue where **the app would sometimes skip the onboarding flow entirely and jump straight to the logged-in view**, even immediately after a user signed up. This behavior was 
inconsistent between the **Preview canvas** and the **iOS Simulator**, making debugging even trickier.

#### Symptoms:

* After successful sign-up, the app should show a tailored onboarding view based on the user‚Äôs role.
* In Preview, onboarding appeared correctly.
* In Simulator, it would skip onboarding and jump directly to the main `LoggedInView`.

#### Root Cause:

This behavior stemmed from my reliance on `localAuthVM.currentUser` alone to determine what to show:

```swift
if localAuthVM.currentUser != nil {
    LoggedInView(authVM: authVM)
} else {
    AuthSwitcherView(authVM: authVM)
}
```

Because the user was cached and loaded immediately after sign-up, `currentUser` was **already non-nil** before navigation occurred ‚Äî **bypassing the onboarding logic** unintentionally.

Also:

* **Preview runs in a clean environment** ‚Äî no persistent UserDefaults or SwiftData ‚Äî so onboarding appeared as expected.
* **Simulator retains cached data** ‚Äî so `currentUser` was restored immediately, skipping onboarding.

#### ‚ùå Problematic Logic (Before)

```swift
if localAuthVM.currentUser != nil {
    LoggedInView(authVM: authVM) // Gets shown even if onboarding not completed
}
```

#### Solution: Introduce Persistent Onboarding Completion Flag

To fix this, I added a `hasCompletedOnboarding` flag to `LocalAuthVM`, stored in `UserDefaults`. This boolean explicitly tracks whether the user has finished onboarding, giving me full control over the app‚Äôs flow.

```swift
var hasCompletedOnboarding: Bool {
    get { UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "hasCompletedOnboarding") }
    set { UserDefaults.standard.set(newValue, forKey: "hasCompletedOnboarding") }
}
```

Then I updated the view logic in `ContentView`:

##### ‚úÖ Improved Flow Logic

```swift
if localAuthVM.currentUser != nil {
    if localAuthVM.hasCompletedOnboarding {
        LoggedInView(authVM: authVM)
    } else {
        OnboardingView(userRole: localAuthVM.currentUser!.role)
    }
} else {
    AuthSwitcherView(authVM: authVM)
}
```

Finally, after the user finishes onboarding, I set the flag:

```swift
localAuthVM.hasCompletedOnboarding = true
```

#### ‚úÖ Result: Predictable, Role-Specific Flow

* Users are always taken to the correct onboarding screen after sign-up.
* App persists onboarding status across launches using `UserDefaults`.
* Clear separation between auth, onboarding, and main app views.
* Debugging is much easier because Preview and Simulator now behave consistently (once cache is cleared).

### 3. Problem: UUID Mismatch During Onboarding

**Issue:** During customer onboarding, the `id` used in `CustomerModel` did not match the `auth.uid()` from Supabase. This happened because the user ID from Supabase (`localAuthVM.currentUser?.id`) wasn't yet available 
when `ContentView` appeared, leading to a temporary `UUID()` being used instead.

**What went wrong:**

* `onAppear` ran too early, before the user was fully signed in.
* A new random UUID was incorrectly assigned, breaking RLS `WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id)`.

**Solution:**
Used `onChange(of: localAuthVM.currentUser)` to defer logic until the user was actually available. This guaranteed the real `auth.uid()` was present before creating or updating the onboarding model.

```swift
.onChange(of: localAuthVM.currentUser) { _, _ in
    if let userIDString = localAuthVM.currentUser?.id,
       let userUUID = UUID(uuidString: userIDString) {
        customerVM = CustomerVM(customerModel: CustomerModel(id: userUUID, ...))
    }
}
```

This reactive approach ensured model updates were synced with Supabase's authenticated user ID.

### 4. Problem: Prop Drilling and State Management

**Issue:** As the app grew, onboarding and shared user state needed to flow through multiple view layers, leading to prop drilling ‚Äî where props were passed down several levels unnecessarily.

**Solution:**
Adopted the new Swift 5.9+ data flow system using `@Observable` view models and `@Environment(...)` injection.

```swift
@Observable class CustomerVM { ... }

@main
struct TrackBiteApp: App {
    @State private var customerVM = CustomerVM(...)

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environment(customerVM) // accessible app-wide
        }
    }
}
```

This eliminated the need to pass state manually through view hierarchies, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
