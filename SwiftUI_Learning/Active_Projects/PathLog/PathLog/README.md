# PathLog

**PathLog** is a personal growth and goal-tracking app designed to help me document my journey through monthly and daily reflections. This app is ongoing — meaning it will continue to grow, change, and evolve over time as 
I learn new techniques, explore new SwiftUI features, and gain deeper insights into my personal development goals.

>  **Note:** This README file is a living document and will be updated as the app progresses.

## What You'll Learn

Through building **PathLog**, I'm aiming to explore and reinforce several areas of app development, including:

- SwiftUI layout, navigation, and data flow
- State management using `@State`, `@Observable`, and `@Environment`
- File organization and modular architecture
- Data persistence (e.g., `Codable`, `UserDefaults`, or Core Data)
- UI/UX principles for journaling and self-reflection
- Custom modifiers, animations, and reusable components

## What the App Does

**PathLog** allows me to:

- Set short-term and long-term goals  
- Create daily or monthly reflections tied to those goals  
- Track progress and revisit past entries  
- Stay motivated through self-review and insight  
- Reflect on recurring themes, habits, or mental shifts over time

The goal is not only functionality, but also personal meaning — building something I’ll actually use daily.

## Final Thoughts

**PathLog** is more than a coding exercise — it’s a mirror of my own self-development. It combines technical learning with personal meaning, making it one of the most authentic projects I’ll build.

This project is ongoing, and as I iterate and improve, I’ll continue to refine the app’s functionality, user interface, and overall vision.

Thanks for reading,
