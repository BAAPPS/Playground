# Active Projects

This repository documents my ongoing personal development projects. Each project serves as a way for me to learn, reflect, and build something meaningful for my future goals. The list will grow and evolve over time.

##  1. PathLog

### Overview

**PathLog** is a self-reflection and goal-tracking app. It helps me track my personal goals, log progress, and reflect on the journeyâ€”either daily or monthly. It's an ongoing project, so this README will continue to evolve as the app develops.
