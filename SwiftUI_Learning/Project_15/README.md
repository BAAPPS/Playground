## What the App Does

AccessibilityApp lets users interact with a map, mark locations they want to visit, and save them. All features are designed to be inclusive, so they’re usable by people who rely on assistive technologies or custom display 
settings.

## Final Thoughts

Accessibility isn’t just a “nice-to-have” — it’s a responsibility.
As Tony Fadell, creator of the iPod, once said:

> “You are defined by what you do and also by what you don’t do.”

Making your app accessible means you’re choosing to include everyone, not just the majority.
