## Why This Challenge?

This challenge provides an excellent opportunity to deepen your understanding of working with real-world APIs, especially those that require data filtering, linking, and multilingual support. HKPopTracks combines 
networking, data parsing, and SwiftUI skills in a focused domain — Cantopop and HK-Pop music — making it both educational and culturally enriching. 

By completing this challenge, I'll gain practical experience in building scalable, data-driven apps that fetch and present complex related data smoothly, a vital skill for modern app development.
