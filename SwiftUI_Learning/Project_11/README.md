# Bookies

**Bookies** is an iOS app that helps you track the books you've read and record your thoughts. This project is built as a continuation of prior learning, combining core SwiftUI techniques with powerful new tools like 
**SwiftData** and **custom UI components**.

* How to use **SwiftData**, Apple’s modern database framework, to persist data.
* How to build a **custom star rating UI component**.
* How to use the `@Binding` property wrapper to pass data between views.
* How to structure SwiftUI apps using a clean and modular approach.

## What the App Does

* Allows users to add books they’ve read.
* Lets users leave a star rating and review for each book.

## Setup Notes

> ❗️When creating the project, **do not enable** SwiftData in the template options. This generates extra boilerplate code that we’ll remove manually to follow the project cleanly.
