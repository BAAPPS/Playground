# WeSplit: A Tip Calculator App in SwiftUI

Welcome to **WeSplit**, a beginner-friendly app project that helps you learn the **basics of SwiftUI** through a practical use case: **splitting a restaurant bill with a tip**.

---

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

* The fundamentals of **SwiftUI** layout and design

* How to let users **enter input** and **make selections**

* How to manage and update **app state** using `@State` and `@Binding`

* How to perform **live calculations** and show real-time results

---

## What the App Does

WeSplit lets users:

* Enter the **cost of their meal**

* Choose a **tip percentage**

* Select how many **people to split the bill with**

* Get a **per-person total** including the tip
