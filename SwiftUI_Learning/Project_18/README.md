# LayoutNGeo

In this project, we explore how SwiftUI handles layout in detail. While some concepts may already be familiar, this project dives deeper into the mechanics of SwiftUI layouts, uncovering behaviors that are often taken for granted. By the end, you'll have a stronger understanding of how views are positioned, sized, and aligned in SwiftUI.

Along the way, you'll also learn how to create advanced layout alignments, leverage `GeometryReader` for special effects, and use some of SwiftUI's more powerful layout features to enhance your own apps.

To follow along, create a new iOS project using the App template and name it `LayoutAndGeometry`. You'll need at least one image in your asset catalog for the chapter on custom alignment guides, but it can be any placeholder image.

## What You'll Learn

- How SwiftUI calculates and applies layouts.
- Creating custom alignment guides.
- Using `GeometryReader` for dynamic layouts and special effects.
- Combining multiple layout techniques to build complex UI components.

## Final Thoughts

By the end of this project, you’ll have a deeper understanding of SwiftUI layout behavior and will be equipped to implement complex, flexible user interfaces in your own apps. Experimenting with alignment guides and `GeometryReader` will help you unlock the full potential of SwiftUI’s layout system.
