## What I Learned

## Challenges and Problems Encountered

### 1. `ContentUnavailableView` Not Displaying Inside `ScrollView`

**Problem:**
When attempting to show a `ContentUnavailableView` to indicate that no photos were available (`photoVM.photos.isEmpty`), the view did not appear as expected. This happened even though the condition was met and the array was empty.

**Root Cause:**
`ScrollView` does not automatically fill all available vertical space, which means placing a `Spacer()` before the `ContentUnavailableView` won‚Äôt push it to the vertical center unless it's wrapped in a parent container that enforces layout stretching (e.g. a `VStack` with `frame(maxHeight: .infinity)` or an outer `ZStack`).

**Solution:**
To ensure that the placeholder view appeared and was vertically centered, we had to wrap the content in a `VStack` and give it an explicit `frame` to expand and fill space. Here's the corrected approach:

```swift
if photoVM.photos.isEmpty {
    VStack {
        Spacer()
        ContentUnavailableView("No Picture", systemImage: "photo.badge.plus")
            .font(.title) // optional size tweak
        Spacer()
    }
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
}
```

Alternatively, using a `ZStack` to overlay the view on an empty scroll view works as well:

```swift
ZStack {
    if photoVM.photos.isEmpty {
        ContentUnavailableView("No Picture", systemImage: "photo.badge.plus")
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
    } else {
        ScrollView {
            LazyVStack {
                // display photos
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This ensures proper layout and visual feedback even when the data is missing.


### 2. Auth Switcher View: Handling Offline Mode and Refresh Token Reset

**Problem:**
The app needed to maintain user authentication state across app restarts and network interruptions. Initially, when the device was offline, the app failed to persist the logged-in state and would revert to the login screen 
because the session refresh failed without a network connection.

Additionally, managing refresh tokens securely and resetting the session upon token expiration was challenging.

**Root Cause:**

* Supabase authentication sessions require valid refresh tokens to restore the session.
* When offline, trying to refresh the token fails, causing the app to lose the user state.
* Refresh tokens were stored in `UserDefaults` for simplicity during development, which is not secure and can lead to inconsistent state.
* The app lacked proper fallback logic to use cached user data when offline.

**Solution:**

* Implemented a network monitor using `NWPathMonitor` to detect connectivity status.
* Modified the session restore logic to:

  * Check network connectivity before attempting token refresh.
  * If offline, load cached user data from local storage (`UserDefaults`) instead of refreshing tokens.
  * If online, refresh the session and update tokens accordingly.
* Added error handling to clear tokens and log out the user when refresh tokens become invalid or expired.
* Plan to migrate refresh token storage to iOS Keychain for enhanced security in production.

**Code Snippet:**

```swift
func restoreSession() async {
    print("üîÅ Attempting to restore session...")
    
    if !networkMonitor.isConnected {
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Offline: loading cached user without refreshing session")
        if let cachedUser = loadCachedUser() {
            currentUser = cachedUser
        }
        return
    }

    guard let refreshToken = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "supabase_refresh_token") else {
        print("üö´ No refresh token found")
        return
    }

    do {
        let session = try await client.auth.refreshSession(refreshToken: refreshToken)
        print("‚úÖ Session restored for: \(session.user.email ?? "unknown")")

        // Fetch user data and cache
        ...
        UserDefaults.standard.set(session.refreshToken, forKey: "supabase_refresh_token")
    } catch {
        print("‚ùå Failed to refresh session: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        currentUser = nil
        UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: "supabase_refresh_token")
        UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: userDefaultKey)
    }
}
```

With these improvements, the app gracefully handles offline scenarios by showing the cached user state and only attempts token refresh when the network is available. It also properly resets the session and cleans up tokens 
on authentication failure, improving reliability and user experience.

### 3. Info Button Missing on Swipe Cards

**Problem:**

In the Tinder-style swipe stack (`TinderStackView`), an `info.circle` button was intended to appear only on the topmost photo card. However, the button was inconsistently missing, even when a photo was visually on top ‚Äî 
especially after swiping some cards away.

This broke the expected user experience and made it unclear how to access the photo's details.

### Root Cause:

The code used to determine which photo was the top card relied on this logic:

```swift
let isTopPhoto = index == photos.count - 1
```

This assumption works **only if**:

* The stack is static, and
* No cards are removed

But in a dynamic swipe view where photos are constantly removed (`remove(photo)`), the indices shift, and the logic can fail to mark the **visually top card** as the top one in data. This causes the button to disappear from the card currently on top of the screen.

Moreover, SwiftUI doesn‚Äôt automatically guarantee Z-stack layering by `ForEach` order ‚Äî without explicit `zIndex()` management, view stacking becomes inconsistent.

---

### üî¥ Before: Problematic Code (Broken Overlay Logic)

```swift
ZStack {
    ForEach(Array(photos.enumerated()), id: \.element.id) { index, photo in
        let isTopPhoto = index == photos.count - 1 // ‚ùå not reliable after removal

        PhotoSwipeView(photo: photo) {
            remove(photo)
        }
        .overlay(
            isTopPhoto ?
            VStack {
                HStack {
                    Spacer()
                    Button {
                        selectedPhoto = photo
                    } label: {
                        Image(systemName: "info.circle")
                            .font(.title)
                            .padding()
                            .background(Color.black.opacity(0.5))
                            .clipShape(Circle())
                            .foregroundColor(.white)
                    }
                    .padding()
                }
                Spacer()
            }
            .offset(x: -100)
            : nil // ‚ùå overlay disappears when top photo is misidentified
        )
        .frame(width: parentSize.width, height: parentSize.height)
        // ‚ö†Ô∏è No zIndex set ‚Äì view layering not controlled
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ After: Fixed Solution with `zIndex` + ID Match

```swift
ZStack {
    ForEach(Array(photos.enumerated()), id: \.element.id) { index, photo in
        let isTopPhoto = photo.id == photos.last?.id // ‚úÖ safe comparison

        PhotoSwipeView(photo: photo) {
            remove(photo)
        }
        .overlay(
            isTopPhoto ?
            VStack {
                HStack {
                    Spacer()
                    Button {
                        selectedPhoto = photo
                    } label: {
                        Image(systemName: "info.circle")
                            .font(.title)
                            .padding()
                            .background(Color.black.opacity(0.5))
                            .clipShape(Circle())
                            .foregroundColor(.white)
                    }
                    .padding()
                }
                Spacer()
            }
            .offset(x: -100)
            : nil
        )
        .frame(width: parentSize.width, height: parentSize.height)
        .zIndex(Double(index)) // ‚úÖ force visual order
    }
}
```

---

### Why This Fix Works

* `photo.id == photos.last?.id` directly compares the photo object to the **last item in the array**, which always represents the top visual card.
* `.zIndex(Double(index))` makes sure cards are layered from bottom to top in the order they appear.
* Overlay logic is now bound to the actual top card, regardless of dynamic data changes.
