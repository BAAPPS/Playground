# Flip & Sum - Guess the Card Sum Value 

A fun and interactive SwiftUI game where you're challenged to match a randomly generated target value by selecting cards with hidden values from a deck. 

The goal is to find the right combination using the fewest moves possible.

---

## What You’ll Build

A SwiftUI-based card game where players:

* Are given a **target number**.
* Choose from a stack of hidden **cards** (each with a random value).
* Try to match the **target sum** using the fewest possible selections.
* Experience **smooth animations** when cards are selected.
* Get instant feedback if the selected sum is too low, too high, or a match.

Features include:

* Interactive UI with dynamic value feedback.
* Shuffle/reset options from the toolbar.
* Score tracking.
* Animations for card flips and match success.
* Progress tracking with rounds or limited turns.

## What You’ll Learn

By completing this project, you'll gain experience in:

* **@State**: Property wrappers to manage state and enable two-way binding.
* **Toolbar integration** with SwiftUI’s `.toolbar()` modifier.
* **Animations**: Custom transitions and flip effects for card interactions.
* **Custom ViewModifiers** for card appearance and feedback styling.
* **Custom containers**: Using custom stacks or layout structs for card grids or piles.
* **Game logic structuring** in SwiftUI: separating logic from view state.
* **Random number generation** and logic control using `Int.random(in:)`.
* **Modular SwiftUI views** with reusable components and data binding.

## Project Structure



## Final Thought

This project is perfect for SwiftUI learners who want to apply practical app-building skills while learning deeper topics like data flow, animations, layout control, and custom modifiers. 

You’ll walk away with a better understanding of SwiftUI’s powerful declarative tools and how to structure a fun, interactive app.

It’s not just about matching numbers — it’s about building intuition for how SwiftUI apps come together.

> Challenge yourself to reduce the turn count. Can you win in the least moves possible?
