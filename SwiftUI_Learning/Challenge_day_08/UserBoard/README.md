# Challenge Day 8 - UserBoard

A SwiftUI app challenge focusing on user authentication, cloud integration, and local data persistence. This app lets users sign up and sign in, then displays a dashboard showing their username, sign-in date, and the total 
number of registered users.

---

## Features

- User authentication using **Supabase Auth** with email/password and `OAuth` support  
- Display of logged-in user’s **username** and **current sign-in timestamp**  
- Real-time count of total users signed up  
- Local data caching and querying using **SwiftData** with `@Model` and `@Query`  
- Filtering and sorting of local session data with predicates and sort descriptors  
- Responsive and state-driven UI built with **SwiftUI**  

---

## Why This Challenge?

This challenge is designed to help me:

- Gain hands-on experience integrating third-party authentication (Supabase) in SwiftUI  
- Understand how to model, filter, and sort data locally with SwiftData’s modern tools  
- Build a clean architecture that separates concerns between UI, data, and authentication logic  
- Practice combining cloud and local persistence techniques for better app responsiveness and offline support  
- Strengthen my SwiftUI skills by handling asynchronous network calls, SwiftData, and dynamic view updates based on user state
