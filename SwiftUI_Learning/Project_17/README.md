# Flashzilla

Flashzilla is an iOS app designed to help users learn new things using flashcards. Each card displays a prompt, such as "to buy," and reveals the answer, like "comprar," when tapped. This digital approach eliminates the need for physical cards while keeping the learning experience interactive and fun.
