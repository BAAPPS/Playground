# SwiftDataProject

This technique project is designed to explore **SwiftData** in detail — starting with foundational concepts and gradually progressing to more complex use cases. SwiftData leverages powerful features from both **Swift** and **SwiftUI** to provide efficient, native data persistence.

While SwiftData simplifies many aspects of data handling, it does require thoughtful implementation, especially in advanced scenarios. This project takes a hands-on approach to understand how it all works under the hood.

> ⚠️ When creating your project, **do not enable SwiftData storage** by default. We’ll be building it manually to better understand the setup.

## What You'll Learn

* How to manually integrate SwiftData into a SwiftUI app
* Core concepts of SwiftData: models, persistence, relationships
* Advanced SwiftData techniques and common pitfalls
* How SwiftUI integrates with SwiftData for reactive data handling

## What the App Does

This app serves as a sandbox for testing and demonstrating SwiftData concepts. It won't follow a specific end-user purpose but will evolve as we implement and test various data modeling and persistence scenarios.

## Final Thoughts

Working with SwiftData in this project has been a great way to deepen my understanding of how data and UI stay in sync in SwiftUI apps. By using **predicates** and **sort descriptors**, I learned how to efficiently filter 
and sort data directly within the SwiftData query system, which keeps the UI reactive and performant.

This experience emphasized how SwiftData leverages SwiftUI’s observation system, allowing changes in the data model to automatically update the views without extra boilerplate. It also showed me the power of combining 
Swift’s type-safe features like key paths with expressive query tools such as predicates.

Overall, the project reinforced the importance of understanding not just the APIs, but also the underlying mechanisms of data flow and state management in SwiftUI. This deeper insight will help me build more robust, 
scalable apps that feel seamless and responsive.
