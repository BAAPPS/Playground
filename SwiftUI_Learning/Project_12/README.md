# SwiftDataProject

This technique project is designed to explore **SwiftData** in detail — starting with foundational concepts and gradually progressing to more complex use cases. SwiftData leverages powerful features from both **Swift** and **SwiftUI** to provide efficient, native data persistence.

While SwiftData simplifies many aspects of data handling, it does require thoughtful implementation, especially in advanced scenarios. This project takes a hands-on approach to understand how it all works under the hood.

> ⚠️ When creating your project, **do not enable SwiftData storage** by default. We’ll be building it manually to better understand the setup.

## What You'll Learn

* How to manually integrate SwiftData into a SwiftUI app
* Core concepts of SwiftData: models, persistence, relationships
* Advanced SwiftData techniques and common pitfalls
* How SwiftUI integrates with SwiftData for reactive data handling

## What the App Does

This app serves as a sandbox for testing and demonstrating SwiftData concepts. It won't follow a specific end-user purpose but will evolve as we implement and test various data modeling and persistence scenarios.

## Final Thoughts

SwiftData is a powerful tool, but like many SwiftUI features, it benefits from understanding what’s happening behind the scenes. This project will help you gain that deeper insight by walking through setup, usage, and edge 
cases manually.
